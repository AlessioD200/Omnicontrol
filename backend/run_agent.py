"""Small helper to start a BlueZ DBus agent and keep it running.

This script is optional: the main FastAPI startup now calls
`manager.bluetooth._ensure_agent()` which will attempt DBus agent
registration. Use this script if you'd like a lightweight separate
agent process managed by systemd.

Run with the backend venv activated (same env as backend service):

    python run_agent.py
